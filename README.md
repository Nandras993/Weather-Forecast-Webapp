# Weather Forecast Webapp

This is a webapp that helps you determine the the weather in the upcoming 5 days by giving it the name of your city/town etc. <br>
I created this app with Python, using streamlit and a weather API.

You can check it out how it works here: https://nandras993-weather-forecast-webapp-weatherapp-rhjlrj.streamlit.app/

### Usage:
Simply write your city's/town's name under "place" and press Enter. <br>
You can select between 1 and 5 days to forecast with the slider in the middle and you can choose which type of weather data you want to see by choosing one in the menu right under the slider.

The temperature data shows you a graph with dates and temperatures in celsius.

The sky data gives you what kind of weather there will be, date, and temperature in celsius.

The weather data is updated every 3 hours.

### Disclaimer:

I used OpenWeather's weather API for this project. <br>
